This is my config parser. There are many like it, but this is mine.

I made this for myself for use in my projects, but feel free to use it
if you want. :)

Usage:

Declare an array of struct config_opt, filling it with


Then, call read_config(char *filename, struct config_opt *opts),
where filename is the name of the config file and opts is a pointer
to your array.

The config file must be in the format option=value. Comment lines
start with a '#'.
